        Modern economy is dominated by technology and technological
        advancement is considered to be an indicator strongly correlated
        to economic development. One of the fastest growing technologies
        - the Information Technology - is capturing almost all spheres
        of economic activities in every minute and this has posed a
        challenge for us to keep pace with the speed of transformation.
        The ever-changing dynamics of demand and supply are getting far
        more complex than before and all business processes are getting
        shaped with speed much faster and easier than before. Such a
        trend is visible not only within the economy but also in the
        global settings and the single most dominant factor in the
        process is the Information Technology (IT). While the use of IT
        is a prime requirement for a business to grow and survive, it is
        equally important for a business to have affordable access to
        sufficient expertise to keep up with the competitive
        environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Considering the above in forefront, <b>PeopleNTech</b>, LLC was formed back in 2005 to provide
        affordable consultancy and staffing services to the small and
        medium enterprises in testing their applications. Over the past
        few years, <b>PeopleNTech</b> increased
        its service capabilities by incorporating diverse expertise in
        its pool of consultants and started career consultancy to meet
        the demands of clients at both ends - employers and job seekers.
        Such an endeavor has been a unique experience for
        <b>PeopleNTech</b> to come up with a new
        realization that, rapidly changing needs in technological
        expertise can effectively be met through boosting skills of the
        potential IT professionals through comprehensive and practical
        training. <b>PeopleNTech</b>, LLC is
        registered with the State of Virginia and New York as a
        Consulting &amp; staffing firm. It is also an Employment Agency
        certified by "New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA)".<br>
        <br>
        In parallel with the Employment Agency, consultancy and staffing
        services <b>PeopleNTech</b> started
        in-house training of its consultants and new recruits on cutting
        edge Testing, Business Analyst, Project Management Professional,
        Database Administration and Network Administration tools that
        are being directly used on the job desks. Positive impact of
        such training resulted in high performance of the testers, QA
        Analysts, Business Analysts, Project Management Professional,
        Database Administrators and Network Administrators in the field.
        Eventually <b>PeopleNTech</b> experienced
        increasing demand for its offered training, so it had taken
        steps to increase its training facilities opening doors for the
        potential IT professionals who were seeking placements in the
        job market with its subsidiary company "<b>PeopleNTech</b>
        Institute of Information Technology (PIIT), Inc." which is
        certified by "State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV)".
        <br>
        <br>
